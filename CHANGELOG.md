## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Data augmentation techniques
- Advanced GUI features (typing indicators, timestamps)
- Unit and integration tests
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- API deployment with FastAPI
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-07

### Added
- **Modular BERT classifier** (`bert_classifier.py`) using Hugging Face Transformers
- **Dynamic model switching** (SVM/BERT) via `config.py` or environment variables
- **Environment-aware `Config` class** with `load_from_env()` support
- **Dataset inspection CLI** (`tools/data_stats.py`) for pattern stats and imbalance warnings
- **Training report logging** including accuracy and classification report for both models

### Changed
- Refactored `intent_classifier.py` to act as a factory delegating to SVM or BERT
- Extracted BERT logic from monolithic structure to separate class
- Reused vectorizer path (`vectorizer.pkl`) for label map in BERT classifier
- Streamlined preprocessing and ensured compatibility with both SVM and BERT

### Improved
- Fully compatible retraining from GUI for both SVM and BERT
- Better logging with loss per epoch, evaluation report, and device info
- Smarter model loading fallback â€” retrains if model file is missing or corrupted

### Security
- Improved model and file error handling
- Safe tokenization and confidence filtering for BERT inference
- Validated intent prediction to avoid index out-of-bounds on malformed inputs

### Performance
- Enabled GPU acceleration for BERT (auto-detection)
- More efficient training with PyTorch DataLoader batching
- Faster switching and execution via unified intent interface

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- **Dataset expansion script** for improving model accuracy
- **4 new intents**: weather, time, music, news
- **Confidence scoring** for better intent classification
- **Improved SVM parameters** with RBF kernel and better hyperparameters
- **Enhanced TF-IDF vectorizer** with n-grams (1-2) and optimized parameters
- **Stratified sampling** for better class representation in training
- **Fallback mechanism** for low-confidence predictions

### Fixed
- Missing `json` import in `model/intent_classifier.py` causing NameError
- Log file rotation permission errors on Windows by adding delay=True
- Scikit-learn version compatibility warnings
- Model loading error handling
- Improved error handling throughout the application

### Changed
- **Expanded dataset from 13 to 22 intents** (69% increase)
- **Increased training patterns from ~100 to 780 patterns** (680% increase)
- **Enhanced TF-IDF vectorizer** with n-grams and better parameters
- **Improved SVM model** with RBF kernel and probability estimation
- **Added confidence threshold** for better intent classification
- Improved error handling in model loading
- Enhanced logging configuration with better file handling
- Better GUI theme implementation
- Added comprehensive project documentation

### Security
- Added proper error handling for file operations
- Implemented safe model loading with fallback to retraining
- Enhanced input validation and sanitization

### Performance
- **Expected accuracy improvement** from 33% to significantly higher
- **Better generalization** with diverse patterns and n-gram features
- **Improved robustness** with confidence scoring and fallback handling
- **Enhanced user experience** with more intents and better responses
